# About Movie Ticket System Project in C
Customers can book movie tickets and view all of the movies playing in the cinema hall through this project, which allows them to book tickets at any time and from anywhere. The movie ticket reservation system was created with this in mind.

Providing customers with service to book a seat in the cinema hall and information about the films at any time and from any location. The consumer may simply learn about the movies that have been released and then make a decision. We will demonstrate our system in this project by using the C programming language.

The notion of File Handling is used in this project. All transactions can be viewed by the administrator. It allows users to see their previous bookings. It allows you to book a ticket at any moment without having to wait for maintenance.
